# Dogs-App

- Description
  
The goal of this project was to create a Dog App using the AngularJS Javascript framework, as part of the Advanced Web Programming Technologies subject. The UI shows a card identifying each breed (with breed name, image and characteristics), with the possibility of exploring more information via the button associated with each one (details page and use of ActivatedRoute).

The limitation of the API parameters has restricted the possibility of creating a search input that displays the search results with the implementation of the breed name in the input. To compensate, Pagination logic was introduced (with a dedicated parameter in the API documentation).

At the same time - and in order to apply as much of the content taught as possible - another page was created in the App with the presentation of a breed that means a lot to me, using 1 carousel to present the information (Dynamic Components and Data Binding).
